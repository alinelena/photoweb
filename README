2. Installation

No special installation is required. The simplest thing is to create a 
folder
a. gunzip -c webgallery.tar.gz | tar xvf -
that suppose to generate a folder WebGallery
b. mkdir test
c. cp -r <path-to-WebGallery>/WebGallery/* test/
d. ls test/*
should show something like that

test/WebGallery.sh   --> the script
test/README   --> this README file
test/test.html  --> just a simple test file

test/css:
style.css    ---> CSS file of the gallery

test/gifs:  --> graphical elements used to generate the galley
back.gif  
back_grey.gif  
next.gif  
next_grey.gif

3. Generating the Gallery
move into the test folder created at 2.
a. cd test
create a new folder in wich you put the pictures that you want in 
Gallery (eg images)
Obs. They will appear in the same order that ls will list them.
b. mkdir images
copy the photos in the newly created folder.
be sure that you get the desired order
c. ls images/*
create the description file (eg info.txt)
d. touch info.txt
to see what the file info.txt should contain run the script and read the 
instructions.
e. sh WebGallery.sh
once everything in place you can generate the gallery
f. sh WebGallery.sh "My first Gallery" images info.txt
a number of targetxx.html files appeared plus index.html

4. Final touch
Open the file test.html in a browser and check that you got the right 
gallery.
Now we can remove the files that are redundant.
rm WebGallery.sh
rm README
rm test.html
rm info.txt   (a better practice will be to save this file for the case 
you want to regenerate the gallery at a later date)
Now the folder test will contain the WebGallery files necessary to add 
to a website. 
Enjoy!!
